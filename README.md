# Wordle

I decided to deign wordle cause it looked interesting t program

8/31/22:
Today I copied over code from BlueJ, Worlde is the client, Word is the class that chooses the word at random, and WordList is a text file containing all the words that could be options. Here are some things I'd like to add:
  1.There seems to be a problem if a letter appears twice in a word so I need to fix that
  2.I want to add a system that shows the letters you can use and the ones that're done
  3.Also add a way to clear the screen and just show each attempt
  4.Maybe move everything to Visual Studios and code it in C++ since it gives me more options for coloring words
